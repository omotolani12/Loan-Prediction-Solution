## Loan Approval Prediction Solution

# Overview
The Loan Approval Predictor is a solution that leverages machine learning models to predict whether a loan application is likely to be approved or not. This solution is based on a dataset containing various features related to loan applications, such as gender, age, income, region, loan amount, credit score, and more. The solution focuses on exploring and addressing potential biases in the model predictions using fairness metrics.

# Data Exploration and Preprocessing
# Data Loading: The solution starts by loading the loan application dataset from the "Loan_Default.csv" file using the Pandas library.

Data Cleaning and Feature Selection: Several columns deemed irrelevant or potentially causing bias are dropped from the dataset. Features like rate_of_interest, year, and various application details are excluded.

Risk Categorization: A new column, 'risk_category', is created based on the 'Status' column, categorizing loans into 'Low Risk' or 'High Risk'.

Handling Missing Values: Missing values are handled by dropping rows with missing values and imputing others with mean or mode values.

Label Encoding: Categorical columns are label-encoded to convert them into numeric form for machine learning model compatibility.

Outlier Detection and Removal: Outliers are detected and removed using a simple z-score-based method.

Model Training
The solution explores multiple machine learning models for loan approval prediction:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Gaussian Naive Bayes
Random Forest Classifier
Gradient Boosting Classifier
The models are trained on a preprocessed dataset and evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification reports.

Fairness Evaluation
Fairness metrics are employed to assess potential bias in the model predictions. The solution uses two fairness metrics:

Demographic Parity Difference: Examines differences in approval rates between different demographic groups (e.g., gender, region, age).
Equalized Odds Difference: Evaluates disparities in true positive rates between different groups.

# Dash App for Loan Prediction
The solution provides a Dash web application that allows users to input details for a loan application and receive a prediction on whether the loan is likely to be approved or not. Users can input information such as gender, age, income, region, loan amount, loan purpose, and more. The app uses a pre-trained Random Forest Classifier model to make predictions.

Running the Solution
EDA and Model Training: Execute the provided Python script for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model training. Ensure the required libraries are installed (pip install dash pandas numpy matplotlib missingno scikit-learn seaborn fairlearn).

Dash App: Run the Dash web application script, ensuring that the required libraries are installed (pip install dash dash-core-components dash-html-components pandas numpy scikit-learn).

Interact with the App: Open the provided web application and interact with it by entering details for a loan application. The app will provide a prediction on loan approval.

# Conclusion
The Loan Approval Predictor solution combines data exploration, machine learning, and fairness evaluation to provide insights into loan approval predictions. It serves as a tool for understanding model behavior and identifying potential biases, contributing to responsible and fair AI practices in the financial domain.
